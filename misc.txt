Bias v/s Variance

Bias Errors - Errors due to assumption about the model(assumptions like linearity in a linear regression)
    High bias is underfitting

Variance Error - Change in model if training dataset is changed(Measure of Variablity in result)
    High variance in overfitting


Exponentially weighted moving average: 
    - v(t) = [(1-beta)*(x(t)) + (beta)*(v(t-1))]     {v = moving average}
    - Bias correction -> v(t) = v(t)/(1-(beta^t)){bias correction is needed when we need correct averages for initial phase}
